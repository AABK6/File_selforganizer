Building on the 2023 Paris Peace Forum, the process seeks to prevent the proliferation of malicious software and harmful practices. The next Paris Peace Forum will host a plenary meeting of the Pall Mall Process, facilitated by France.  The process will leverage the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, specifically its principle 5, and the associated working group to engage stakeholders and build momentum for concrete normative proposals.  The Forum will also focus on raising awareness and dialogue with reluctant actors and contexts to promote universal and responsible implementation of existing and future principles against cyber proliferation.",
