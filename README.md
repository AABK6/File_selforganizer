# Semantic File Organizer

#### Description:

This project analyzes and organizes files based on their semantic content using Google's Gemini API. It reads file content from various formats, extracts themes, tags, and summaries, proposes an organizational structure, and organizes files accordingly.

## Features

1. **Content Analysis**: Uses an LLM to extract tags and summaries from files.

2. **Proposed Organization**: Leverages the LLM to suggest a meaningful folder structure based on the analysis of all files.

3. **User Control**: Allows the user to approve the proposed structure before files are moved.

4. **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a JSON report of the analysis and final structure.

5. **Support for Multiple File Formats**: Handles `.txt`, `.md`, `.doc`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` files.
